# SQLite Database Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Successfully

Your Prisma schema has been successfully converted to use SQLite and the database has been created!

### What was done:

1. **Schema Conversion**: 
   - Changed datasource from PostgreSQL to SQLite
   - Converted `Json` fields to `String` fields (to store JSON as text)
   - Replaced all `enum` types with `String` fields (SQLite doesn't support enums)
   - Changed `String[]` arrays to `String` fields (SQLite doesn't support arrays)

2. **Database Creation**:
   - Created SQLite database file: `search_llm.db`
   - All 18 tables were successfully created with proper schema

3. **Database Tables Created**:
   - users
   - addresses  
   - restaurants
   - menus
   - menu_categories
   - dishes
   - tables
   - reservations
   - orders
   - order_items
   - payments
   - loyalty_cards
   - loyalty_transactions
   - reviews
   - promotions
   - inventory
   - ingredient
   - _PromotionDishes (junction table)

## üìÅ Files Created

- `search_llm.db` - Your SQLite database
- `check_db.py` - Script to verify database structure
- `database_example.py` - Example Python class for database operations

## üîß How to Use

### Option 1: Direct SQLite (Recommended)
Use the `SearchLLMDB` class in `database_example.py`:

```python
from database_example import SearchLLMDB

db = SearchLLMDB()
# Create users, restaurants, etc.
user_id = db.create_user("email@example.com", 1234567890, "John", "Doe", "password")
```

### Option 2: Raw SQL
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('search_llm.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
results = cursor.fetchall()
```

### Option 3: Try Prisma Again Later
The Prisma client generation had issues, but you can try:
```bash
python -m prisma generate
```

## üéØ Key Schema Changes for SQLite Compatibility

- `Json` ‚Üí `String` (store JSON as text)
- `UserRole` enum ‚Üí `String` with values: "CLIENT", "WAITER", "CHEF", "MANAGER", "ADMIN"
- `OrderStatus` enum ‚Üí `String` with values: "PENDING", "CONFIRMED", "PREPARING", "READY", "OUT_FOR_DELIVERY", "COMPLETED", "CANCELLED"
- `PaymentMethod` enum ‚Üí `String` with values: "CASH", "CIB", "EDAHABIA", "PAYPAL", "STRIPE", "GUIDINI_PAY"
- `String[]` gallery ‚Üí `String` (store comma-separated or JSON)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Use the database with your application
2. Add more helper methods to `database_example.py` as needed
3. Consider using an ORM like SQLAlchemy if you need more advanced features
4. The database is ready for your search-llm project!

Your SQLite database is fully functional and ready to use! üéâ
